# Project Structure

This document outlines the organization of our codebase, focusing on component architecture and file organization.

## Component Organization

Components are organized following this pattern:

### Naming Convention Breakdown

1. **Namespace**: 
   - Currently using `milestone1` as the primary namespace
   - Future milestones will have their own namespaces (milestone2, milestone3, etc.)

2. **Usecase**: 
   - Uses kebab-case for clarity
   - Can be as descriptive as needed
   - Examples:
     - `competitive-analysis-deliverable`
     - `user-journey-mapping`
     - `stakeholder-interviews`

3. **Component Name**:
   - Uses PascalCase
   - Should be descriptive of the component's purpose
   - Example: `AnalysisChart.tsx`, `InterviewSummary.tsx`

### Example Structure

```
components/
└── generated/
  └── milestone1/
    ├── competitive-analysis-deliverable/
      ├── ComparisonMatrix.tsx
      └── InsightsDashboard.tsx
    └── user-journey-mapping/
      ├── JourneyTimeline.tsx
      └── TouchpointCard.tsx
```

## Best Practices

1. **Component Isolation**
   - Each component should be self-contained
   - Shared utilities should be lifted to appropriate utility folders

2. **Naming Clarity**
   - Use clear, descriptive names that indicate component purpose
   - Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

3. **File Organization**
   - Keep related components together under the same usecase
   - Consider creating index files for easier imports

4. Additional namespaces may be added as the project evolves
5. Component documentation should be maintained alongside the component files
